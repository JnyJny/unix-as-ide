# Conclusion

This is the last post in the [Unix as IDE series](http://blog.sanctum.geek.nz/series/unix-as-ide/); I’ve tried to offer a rapid survey of the basic tools available just within a shell on Linux for all of the basic functionality afforded by professional IDEs. At points I’ve had to be not quite as thorough as I’d like in explaining certain features, but to those unfamiliar to development on Linux machines this will all have hopefully given some idea of how comprehensive a development environment the humble shell can be, and all with free, highly mature, and standard software tools.
